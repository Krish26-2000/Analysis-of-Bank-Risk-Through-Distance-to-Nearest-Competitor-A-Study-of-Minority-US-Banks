##Abstract
 Financial institutions, particularly banks, operate within a competitive market influenced by various competitors of differing sizes, structures, and market dominance. This
 study investigates how alterations in inter-bank distances, serving as an indicator of competition, impact the risk-taking behavior of racial minority banks, with a specific focus on
 African-American banks. The findings reveal that as the proximity of competitor banks increases, the propensity for risk-taking diminishes among minority banks. Essentially, 
 banks tend to engage in riskier lending practices when faced with heightened competition due to closer physical proximity of their competitors. Furthermore, this study explores the
 intricate competitive landscape among other minority banks, shedding light on potential factors contributing to the observed decline in the number of African-American banks.
